# Tangram

Tangram is a programmable build system and package manager that makes your builds **simple**, **reproducible**, **cacheable**, and **distributable**.

- **Simple.** Write your builds in TypeScript with autocomplete and type checking.
- **Reproducible.** Stop debugging errors caused by inconsistent package versions.
- **Cacheable.** Stop building the same thing over and over again.
- **Distributable.** Transparently offload your builds to a cluster or the cloud.

## Install.

Install Tangram on macOS or Linux with the command below. No root permissions required.

```
curl https://install.tangram.dev | sh
```
